# Real Time Operating System - RTOS
Building my own Real Time Operating system using ```STM32F411 MCU``` which is based on ```ARM-Cortex-M4``` architecture. The board which I'm using is ```Nucleo-F411RE```

## Documments Required

The following doccuments will help in buiding our own RTOS :
1. [STM32F411 MCU Reference Manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/rm0383-stm32f411xce-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf) - This will contain information about STM32F411 micro controller unit registers and what they are used for
2. [ARM-Cortex-M4 User Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0553/a/) This consist information about Cystic Timer and features of arm cortex m4
3. [STM32f411 DataSheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f411re.pdf) - This will contain all the connection details of the board
4. [Nucleo-F411RE User Manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um1724-stm32-nucleo64-boards-mb1136-stmicroelectronics.pdf) Conists the information of our development board
